## 📝 Project Description

**Student Hub** is a comprehensive web interface designed to help students at HUIT (Ho Chi Minh City University of Industry and Trade) efficiently manage their academic life. It provides a central dashboard for organizing courses, assignments, study materials, and personal planning.

[cite\_start]This repository contains the front-end structure (HTML/CSS/JS) for the core pages of the application, focusing on a modern and engaging user experience.

## 🎨 Design & UI Highlights

The project is built with a modern design aesthetic, featuring:

  * *Dark Theme:** Uses a consistent dark gradient background (`linear-gradient(135deg, #0f0f0f, #1a1a2e, #16213e)`) across the application for a professional and eye-friendly experience.
  * *Glassmorphism/Opacity:** Main components (sidebar, info boxes, course cards) utilize background blurring (`backdrop-filter: blur(10px)`) and opacity to achieve a stylish, layered Glassmorphism effect.
  * *Gradient Typography:** Large titles and key elements employ vibrant color gradients (e.g., `linear-gradient(90deg, #ffffff, #a0a0ff)`) to enhance visual appeal.
  * *Micro-Interactions:** Most cards and buttons feature smooth `transition` and `transform` effects on hover, making the interface dynamic and highly responsive.
  * *Animations:** Components fade into view (`fadeIn` / `fadeInUp`) for a smooth loading experience.

## ✨ Key Modules & Pages
